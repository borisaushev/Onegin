If seriously he hath disease
And nothing more important sees
A paragon of virtue he!
But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
A dying man with art to soothe,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And physic bring with mournful face,
To sigh and meditate alone:
II
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Inheritor of all his race.
Let me present ye to the man,
Who without more prevarication
The hero is of my narration!
Was born beside the Neva, where
It may be ye were born, or there
I also wandered there of old,
of the knight-errant Ruslan in search of his fair lady Liudmila, who
III
Having performed his service truly,
Deep into debt his father ran
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
At last became a ruined man.
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Morality taught scarce at all
Gently for pranks he would reprove
And in the Summer Garden rove.
IV
And my Eugene the path must trace
The path of hope and tender fear
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The giddy world at last shall see.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In the French language perfectly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
He is a charming youth and wise.
V
We all of us of education
A something somehow have obtained,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
With us is easily attained.
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Pedantic although scholar like,
In truth he had the happy trick
Without constraint in conversation
Of touching lightly every theme.
Amid a serious disputation,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
VI
Latin is just now not in vogue,
But if the truth I must relate,
A mild quotation to translate,
A little Juvenal to spout,
Two verses he could recollect
In history he took no pleasure,
The dusty chronicles of earth
For him were but of little worth,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Within his memory there lay,
From Romulus unto our day.
VII
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Existence would not make a curse,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
And at economy was great
That is, he could elucidate
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
If the raw product they possess
The medium is required of gold.
The father scarcely understands
His son and mortgages his lands.
VIII
But upon all that Eugene knew
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But say he was a genius who
In one thing really did excel.
It occupied him from a boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
It whiled his idle hours away
And wholly occupied his day
The amatory science warm,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
For which the poet agonized
Laid down his life of sun and storm
